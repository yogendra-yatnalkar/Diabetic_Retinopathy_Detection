How to detect if the patient has diabetic retinopathy:
1. Abnormal growth of blood vessles. (many times these are smaller than the normal ones)
2. Hard Exudates - lipid which comes out of retina capillaries
                   lipid - fatty acids which are soluble in orgaic solvents
                   organic solvents - compunds which has dissolving capabilities and which has carbon contents.
3. Cotton wool spots - again bright as hard exudates but they are less bright and less in quantity.
4. Thickness of blood vessels at some random points.
5. Spilling of blood from the blood vessels.
